## Zero Human Effort Segmentation 

**Advisors:** Badri Roysam, Hien Nguyen
**Abstract:** Toward Zero Human Efforts: Iterative Training Framework for Noisy Segmentation Label

The performance of most of the state-of-the-art instance segmentation networks heavily rely upon the quality of training samples. However, most of the human annotations are extremely labor-intensive. Thus, we propose an efficient unsupervised learning framework to robustly segment nuclei. We first use an iterative training process to improve segmentation quality without human labels. Then introduce a background boosting technique to enhance the segmentation accuracy We achieved high fidelity segmentation especially among crowed objects: mean average precision 0.95, mean IoU 79.1% over 200,000 cells, improved by 3% compared to original MRCNN
