## Zero Human Effort Segmentation 

- Advisors: Badri Roysam, Hien Nguyen
- Abstract: Toward Zero Human Efforts: Iterative Training Framework for Noisy Segmentation Label
> The performance of most of the state-of-the-art instance segmentation networks heavily rely upon the quality of training samples. However, most of the human annotations are extremely labor-intensive. Thus, we propose an efficient unsupervised learning framework to robustly segment nuclei. We first use an iterative training process to improve segmentation quality without human labels. Then introduce a background boosting technique to enhance the segmentation accuracy We achieved high fidelity segmentation especially among crowed objects: mean average precision 0.95, mean IoU 79.1% over 200,000 cells, improved by 3% compared to original MRCNN

## Compressive Image Recovery 
	Adapted a pixel inpainting neural network Wasserstein GAN to recover the compressed seismic images 
	Proposed a non-uniform sampling strategy aiming for the optimal design of seismic signal acquisition 
	Achieved reliable recovery from compressed rates of ×2 to ×16; improved MSE 24% and 31% respectively, and performed ×300 faster as compared with conventional approaches

- Abstract: Generative inpainting network applications on seismic image compression
> An appropriately designed Wasserstein generative adversarial network is designed based on a generative adversarial network architecture trained on several historical surveys, capable of learning the statistical properties of the seismic wavelets. The usage of validating and performance testing of compressive sensing are three steps. First, the existence of a sparse representation with different compression rates for seismic surveys is studied. Then, non-uniform samplings are studied, using the proposed methodology. Finally, recommendations for non-uniform seismic survey grid, based on the evaluation of reconstructed seismic images and metrics, is proposed.
