I’m all about bringing people together and having fun! As a dragon boat enthusiast for 5+ years, I formed a team of 50 Adobe employees to race in the Bay Area Dragon Boat Novice Race. We paddled our way to the Division Championship and medals in 2023 and 2024! I also founded the Adobe Dragon Boat Club to keep the excitement going and build a vibrant, connected community at work. 🚣‍♀️✨
