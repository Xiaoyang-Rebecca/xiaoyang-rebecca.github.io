Work Experience
======
* **2021 - Present**: Research Engineer / Machine Learning Engineering Manager  
  * **Adobe Inc (San Jose, CA)**  
  * **2024**: Led the development of an **Automatic Evaluation Framework** for benchmarking the performance of Image and Video GenAI models. Advanced standards in **Responsible AI** through industry-leading practices. Check out my public [talk](https://embeddedvisionsummit.com/2024/2024/session/harm-and-bias-evaluation-and-solution-for-adobe-firefly-2/?q=/2024/session/harm-and-bias-evaluation-and-solution-for-adobe-firefly-2/).  

  * **2023**: Engineering founder and Release Lead of a cross-functional **GenAI model development inference SDK**, scaling the contributor team from **10 to 100+**. Shipped as **Adobe Firefly**, a groundbreaking GenAI creation platform known for safe commercial use. Its applications in Photoshop were recognized as one of [Time’s Best AI Inventions of 2023](https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2023/6326984/adobe-photoshop-generative-expand-and-generative-fill/).
