We developed a robust method to detect & profile injury-caused  alterations to brain tissue at the multi-cellular scale:
- Analyzed the interaction of multiple cell types rather than a single cell type
- Used a single measurement to measure the local neuron neighborhoods by combining the density and distance of neuron-glial influence; these measurements previously could only be used independently
- Represented biological cyto-architecture better than existing methods in terms of the proximity level from neighbors to centers, fitting the uneven distribution of cells, and performing robust to distance parameters

We implemented feature selection on intercellular neighborhood analysis by using Sparse Group LASSO and Tree LASSO algorithms
- Fitted pre-defined features with intrinsic hierarchical structures
- Enabled to extract significant individual features and feature groups simultaneously
- Produced stable and efficient feature selection results
