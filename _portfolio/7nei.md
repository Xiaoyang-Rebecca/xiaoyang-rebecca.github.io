•	Modeled the spatial cellular co-appearance transactions by Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation
•	Used hierarchical Tree LASSO to select significant neuron-neighbor pairs across various situations
•	Provided proofs for pathological and drug analysis by revealing the co-location and exclusive patterns with the association-rule based data mining method
