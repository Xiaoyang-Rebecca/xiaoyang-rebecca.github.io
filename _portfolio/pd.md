## Pick-up Drop-off Design

-----------

We used reinforcement learning to design a route for the deliveryman to send all of the blocks to their respective drop-off cells by using the least number of steps. A primary Q learning method was deployed. We also designed a visualization module to display the Q values in real-time.
