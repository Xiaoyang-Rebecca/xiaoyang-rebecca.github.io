Two dimensional wavelet analysis is widely on recovering useful information from damages such as noise and blurs. Noise may come from contamination of the samples or equipment and
blurs of images commonly due to the restriction of time and limitation of high standard imaging equipment. To study the capability of wavelet transform on noisy and blurring image
reconstruction, we applied de-noising and de-blurring on a multiplex-channel SPERO dataset.
