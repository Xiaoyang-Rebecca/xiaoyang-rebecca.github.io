## **1. What is K-Means Clustering?**
K-Means is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** used for **clustering** data points into groups based on similarity. It is widely used in **data segmentation, customer profiling, and image compression**.

### **How Does K-Means Work?**
1. Select **K** (the number of clusters).
2. Randomly initialize **K centroids**.
3. Assign each data point to the **nearest centroid** (forming clusters).
4. Update centroids by computing the **mean** of all points in a cluster.
5. Repeat steps **3-4** until centroids **stop moving** or a stopping condition is met.

## **2. Intuitive Example: Grouping Customers by Spending Behavior**
Imagine a shopping mall wants to group customers into **three clusters**:
- **Low spenders**
- **Medium spenders**
- **High spenders**

K-Means can analyze past transactions and segment customers into groups with **similar spending habits**, helping businesses target their marketing efforts efficiently.

## **3. K-Means Algorithm Explained Mathematically**
K-Means minimizes the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)**:

$$ J = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{x \in C_i} || x - \mu_i ||^2 $$

Where:
- \\( K \\) = Number of clusters
- \\( x \\) = Data point
- \\( \mu_i \) = Centroid of cluster \\( C_i \\)
- \\(|| x - \mu_i ||^2 \\) = Squared distance between a point and its cluster centroid

The goal is to **find cluster assignments that minimize this function**.

## **4. Learn with Code: Implementing K-Means from Scratch**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class KMeans:
    def __init__(self, k=3, max_iters=100, tol=1e-4):
        """
        K-Means clustering algorithm implementation.
        
        Parameters:
        k (int): Number of clusters.
        max_iters (int): Maximum iterations.
        tol (float): Convergence threshold.
        """
        self.k = k
        self.max_iters = max_iters
        self.tol = tol
        self.centroids = None

    def fit(self, X):
        """
        Train K-Means on dataset X.
        """
        np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
        self.centroids = X[np.random.choice(X.shape[0], self.k, replace=False)]
        
        for _ in range(self.max_iters):
            clusters = self.assign_clusters(X)
            new_centroids = np.array([X[clusters == i].mean(axis=0) for i in range(self.k)])
            
            if np.max(np.abs(new_centroids - self.centroids)) < self.tol:
                break
            self.centroids = new_centroids

    def assign_clusters(self, X):
        """
        Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
        """
        distances = np.sum((X[:, None] - self.centroids) ** 2, axis=2)
        return np.argmin(distances, axis=1)

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predict cluster for new data points.
        """
        return self.assign_clusters(X)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
    X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=3, random_state=42)
    
    kmeans = KMeans(k=3)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    clusters = kmeans.predict(X)
    
    # Plot results
    plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.6)
    plt.scatter(kmeans.centroids[:, 0], kmeans.centroids[:, 1], s=200, c='red', marker='X')
    plt.title("K-Means Clustering")
    plt.show()
```

## **5. Key Takeaways**
- **K-Means** is an iterative clustering method that minimizes WCSS.
- Choosing **K** is crucialâ€”**Elbow Method** is often used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **K-Means assumes clusters are spherical and evenly sized**â€”it may not work well for non-convex clusters.
