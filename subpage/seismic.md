## Compressive Image Recovery 

--------------

Seismic image acquisition can be time and economic costs. We adopted an appropriately designed Wasserstein generative adversarial network on compressed seismic image recovery. We first trained a pixel inpainting network on several historical surveys, and then propose a non-uniform sampling recommendation based on the evaluation of reconstructed seismic images and metrics. Our results show approximately 300 times faster than the conventional method, and better seismic reconstruction accuracy than the original GAN network.
