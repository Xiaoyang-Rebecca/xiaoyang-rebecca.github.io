# Zero-human-effort Segmentation 
--------------

We innovatively proposed an efficient unsupervised learning framework to segment nuclei robustly without human annotations. We first use an iterative training process to improve segmentation quality without human labels. Then we introduce a background boosting technique to enhance the segmentation accuracy. We achieved high fidelity segmentation especially among crowed objects, and IoU improved by 3% compared to original MRCNN.
